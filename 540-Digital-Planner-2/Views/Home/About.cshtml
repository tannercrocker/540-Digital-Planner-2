<h2>Automatic Assignment</h2>
<p>
    Before the planner can automatically assign events, you must tell it when you are avialable.
    Set how much time you have each day by visiting the <b>Availabilities</b> page.  You can then set events as
    <b>Automatic</b>.  These events will automatically be assigned based on their priority, length, and due date.
